# EmailSignatureGenerator
This is a simple bash script that prompts the user for input then uses it to generate an HTML Email Signature.
Created as part of automating macOS system imaging processes for a client, but can be used as a template for your own signatures.

*GUI Popups work on macOS but may not work on other Linux/Unix OS. Use non-GUI version if not on macOS.*

Use the included AppleScript to import the HTML file into Microsoft Outlook for Mac 2016+ automatically.
